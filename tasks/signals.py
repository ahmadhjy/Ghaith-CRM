"""
Signal handlers for the `tasks` app.

Currently this file is intentionally minimal so that the AppConfig.ready()
import does not fail. Add your actual Django signal handlers here as needed.

# Example skeleton (commented out):

# from django.db.models.signals import post_save
# from django.dispatch import receiver
# from .models import YourModel
#
# @receiver(post_save, sender=YourModel)
# def yourmodel_post_save(sender, instance, created, **kwargs):
#     if created:
#         # Do something on creation
#         pass
